Found an issue? Want to create a new theme?
Sorry, but ATM it's kind of hard to set this up, but here are the steps:

1. Create a new create-react-app project using `npx create-react-app temp --template typescript`
2. Go into the created folder, run: `npm i react-spinners axios react-responsive`
3. Create a fork of this repository on GitHub
4. Navigate to the src folder, run `git clone https://github.com/your-username/dawn-ui`
5. Copy the App.tsx into your own App.tsx
6. Make changes
